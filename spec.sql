Hi, I'm Sara and I own a hair salon called 'A Cut Above'. Since its opening in 2016, my business has been growing and I've already hired 
2 employees to help me service my many clients. It is becoming very difficult to keep track of appointments as well as 
the money coming in. Therefore, I would like to have a database created that will record this information.

I need to keep track of my clients' first names, last names, phone numbers, and the time of their appointments.
I also need to record which services were scheduled/provided and how much money we received/are owed for each.

I will need the following reports:
1) upoming appointments- seperate report for each hairdresser, ordered by appointment time with more recent appointment 
at the top of the list. Report should be formatted like this: Client first name client last name apt day of the week, apt datetime - service (price) phone number
2) money owed- clients who already had their appointments and still haven't paid. report should show how many days late the payment is 
3) best client- I need to know which client brought in the most money(including tips)
4) report showing amount of money I made per month (not including tips)


Q: Do clients need to pay at their appointments?
A: I sometimes allow clients to pay at a later time. 

Q: Do you ever recieve tips?
A: yes!

Q: Do you ever have more than one appointment at a time?
A: yes, but not with the same hairdresser

Q: Do you and your employees all work full time?
A: No, I only come in at our busiest time: 3-5 pm 
	Leah works full time: 10-7 
	Penina works: 2-7
I need to ensure that appointments are never accidently booked at times that we aren't in 

Q: Are you open all days of the week
A: No, only Sunday- Thursday

Q: What services do you offer? 
A: Haircuts for $25 and hairstyles for $36
